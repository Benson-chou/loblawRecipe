## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project was to practice and enhance skills in web scraping, data engineering, and full-stack development while addressing a common daily struggle: finding affordable and convenient meal options. By integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced optimization techniques, this project also explores how AI can be leveraged to make everyday tasks, like grocery shopping, more efficient and cost-effective. The flyer details were sourced by scraping data through API calls to Backflipp, adding an additional layer of real-time data integration and processing.
